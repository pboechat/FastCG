# FastCG

**FastCG** is a C++ application framework for rapid prototyping of 3D applications.

Developed during my *realtime rendering* master course. 

It features:

 - basic materials: diffuse, specular, bump, etc.
 - deferred rendering
 - screen space ambient occlusion
 - model/texture importer (through DevIL and assimp)
 - very simple shader management
 - true type font support
 - Unity-like API
 - OpenGL 3.3
